1. **Differences Found in Your Experiment Between the Two Algorithms Across a Variety of Images**
   
   **Accuracy of Keypoint Detection**
   From the oreo image we can see that the SIFT is more accurate for images that are more exact  (the OREO logo is exactly in the scene and object) and the SIFT robustness with texture and fine detail, meanwhile ORB can detect more generalize feature, like the bottle cap in the bottle image.
   
   **Rotation and Scale**
   From you can see in the SIFT image for oreo image, SIFT can be more responsive for rotated images (you can see it because there is a rotated oreo image), meanwhile ORB cannot detect it.
   
   **Keypoint count**
   K keypoint for SIFT is more than the ORB

2. **Failure Cases Observed Across Your Samples**
   
   SIFT perform well across all images, 
   ORB fail to recognize keypoints in smooth and 
   
3. **Robust Feature Extractor for Keypoint Matching**
