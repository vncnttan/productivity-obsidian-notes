1. **Differences Found in Your Experiment Between the Two Algorithms Across a Variety of Images**
   
   **Accuracy of Keypoint Detection**
   From the oreo image we can see that the SIFT can accurately pinpoint where is the Oreo logo located in variety of other snack logos. This highlight SIFT ability to detect detailed and fine-grained features, rather than Orb that performs poorly on searching the Oreo logo (it matches all over the place).
   
   **Rotation and Scale**
   From the observation, both did a good job at recognizing images that are distorted or flipped. but from the phone example, we can see that orb are more confident on guessing the similarity on the text and lock icon, meanwhile SIFT is more confident on identifying the logos.
   
   **Keypoint count**
   K keypoint for SIFT is more than the ORB
   
   **Sensitivity to Noise**

2. **Failure Cases Observed Across Your Samples**
   
   SIFT perform well across all images, 
   ORB fail to recognize keypoints in smooth and 
   
3. **Robust Feature Extractor for Keypoint Matching**
