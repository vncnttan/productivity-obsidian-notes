I am excited about the possibility of contributing to the team and am looking forward to the interview.

I noticed that the resume registered in BINUS Enrichment Apps system might not fully reflect my relevant experiences and skills for this role. Therefore, I am attaching an updated version of my resume that better showcases my qualifications and alignment with the requirements of this position. 

Please feel free to reach out if you require any additional information or documents. Thank you again for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.

Best Regards,
Vincent Tanjaya
