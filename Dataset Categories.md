##### Perception & Reasoning
Spatial Reasoning:
- Small Roads → Narrow Roadway
- One Way → Unidirectional Traffic

Navigation and Planning:
- Bike Lane → Bike Lanes → ini gabungin ke Lane Recognition 
- Busway Lane → Lane Recognition
- Navigation Decisions → Navigation Decision Making

#### Safety & Compliance
Environmental Conditions:
- Flood → Kemungkinan dihapus
- Night Street  → Kemungkinan dihapus
- Potholes → Inadequate Road Conditions

Obstacles & Blockages
- Road Blocks → Obstacle Recognition
- Train Railways → Train Railway Recognition
- Parking → Long-Short Parking

Road Infrastructure & Signage
- Traffic Lights → Traffic Signal
- Road Signs → Road Sign 
- Turning → Trajectory Planning Signs

##### Urban Flow Complexity
Dynamic Agent Behavior
- Street Paddler → VRU Cut-in
- Brake Check → Vehicle Recognition
- Lane Takeover → Vehicle Cut-in
- Deadlock → Kemungkinan gabung dengan Misbehaved Driver
- Opposite Direction → Contra-Flow Vehicle Detection
