#### Attention Mechanism
Technique that allows model to choose and focus on specific (important) part of the input data. It helps our model to give more *attention* to relevant/important features when creating decision or generating an output.

Attention network will give **attention weights** for each element inputs to help model selectively **concentrate on certain aspects of information**.

Attention will help model to focus on specific information that will help the task, rather than learning from all the input data all at once.


- Give translation task for example!
