Linear Regression is a method to predict value of a variable based on the value of other corresponding variables.

- **Dependent Variable** (target feature): Variable that the task is trying to predict, relies on the independent variable.
- **Independent Variable** (non-target features): Variable that is used to predict the target feature.

- **Single Linear Regression**
  Memiliki 1 independent variable (x)
- **Multiple Linear Regression**
  Memiliki lebih dari 1 independent variable (x)

# What is Data Standardization / Data Normalization?

Converting data into a consistent, uniform format to ensure it can be easily processed, analyzed, and interpreted.

- **Standard Scaler**
  Centers data around a mean of **zero** and standard deviation of **one**.
- **MinMax Scaler**
  Scales features to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1
