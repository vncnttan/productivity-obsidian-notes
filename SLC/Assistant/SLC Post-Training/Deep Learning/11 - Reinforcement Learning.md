# Q Learning
A type of reinforcement learning that enables a model to iteratively learn and improve over time by taking the correct action using Q-value, which is used to measure the expected benefits of taking specific actions in certain states.

#### Deep Q-Network
Reinforcement learning apprach that utilizes a neural network to approximate the Q-value function, consisting of two neural networks with two different goals: 
- Computing Q-values
- Calculating target Q-values during training (**target network**)

An agent needs to find a balance between **exploration** (trying new actions to understand the environment) and **exploitation** (taking the best actions based on current knowledge or predicted Q-values). 
This can be controlled by the exploration rate, determining how often the agent explores vs. exploits.
