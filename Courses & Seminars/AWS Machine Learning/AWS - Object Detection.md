`Identify all objects in an image with bounding boxes`

Can train from scratch or use pre-trained models based on imageNet

Two variants: 
- MXNet 
	- CNN with Single Shot multibox Detector algorithm (SSD)
		- VGG-16 / RESNET-50
	- Transfer learning mode / incremental training
	
- Tensorflow
	- Uses ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet from the Tensorflow Model Garden
