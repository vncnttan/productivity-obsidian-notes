#### Inputting Missing Data
- Mean Replacement → Replace with the means of the column
	- Fast & Easy
	- Ineffective when outliers are present
	- Generally pretty terrible
- Dropping Data → Drop NaN data
	- If not many rows contain missing data
	- May affect and bias the data
	- Fast & Easy
	- Almost anything is better
- Using Machine Learning
	- [[K-Nearest Neighbor]] → Take K “most similar” row and average their values
		- Assumes numerical data, not categorical → As the workaround can uses hamming distance, but it is better using Deep Learning method.
	- Deep Learning
		- Build a machine learning model to impute data for your machine learning model
		- Complicated
	- Regression
		- Find linear / non-linear relationships between the missing feature and other features
		- Most advanced technique: MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations)
- Just get more data!
