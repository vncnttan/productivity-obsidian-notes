**Use cases** 
- Streaming ETL: data select columns, make simple transformations, on streaming 
- Continuous metric generation: 
- Responsive analytics: live leaderboard for a mobile game look for certain criteria and build alerting (filtering)

**Features** 
- Pay only for resources consumed (but itâ€™s not cheap) 
- Serverless; scales automatically 
- Use IAM permissions to access streaming source and destination(s) 
- SQL or **Flink** to write the computation (SQL is going byebye because Flink is way superior in streaming :D )
- Schema discovery 
- Lambda can be used for pre-processing
