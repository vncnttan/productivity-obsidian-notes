- Class Imbalance (CI)
	- One facet (demographic group) has fewer training values than another
- Difference in Proportions of Labels (DPL)
	- Imbalance of positive outcomes between facet values
- Kullback Leibler Divergence (KL), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JS)
	- How come outcome distributions of facets diverge
- Lp-norm
	- P-norm difference between distributions of outcomes from facets
- Total Variation Distance (TVD)
	- L1-norm difference between distributions of outcomes between facets
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
	- Maximum divergence between outcomes in distributions from facets
- Conditional Demographic Disparity (CDD)
	- Disparity of outcomes between facets as a whole, and by subgroups
