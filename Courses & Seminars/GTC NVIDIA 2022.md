# 5 Paths to a Career in AI
Speaker
- Louis Stewart, Head of Strategic Initiatives, Developer Ecosystem, NVIDIA
- Dr. Jay Lee, Ohio Eminent Scholar and Founding Director of Industrial AI Center at University of Cincinnati, Predictronics/University of Cincinnati
- Chelsea Sumner, NALA Healthcare AI Startups Lead, NVIDIA
- Laura Leal-Taixé, Professor, Technical University Munich
-  Carrie Gotch, Creator and Content Strategy 3D/AR, Adobe
- Justin Taylor, Vice President, Artificial Intelligence, Lockheed Martin

How to break into an AI career:
BE CURIOUS! and try. Be willing to fail and repeat until you get it. Keep asking question!
COMMUNICATE! communicate to other people, you need to have communication skill, to other people in their field.
Besides those areas, we look for relevant experience and project work that stands out and can be relevant to the role you are applying for.

What goal does internship help:
IT'S VERY CRITICAL! to narrow in of what do you want, and make a connective tissue with other people on those field. Because when you have all of this exp, you will have confidence on your works.
algorithm -> data -> domain
Internship will connect those gap, because we learn those separately.

What Advancements have been made:
Now everyone more involved with AI and investing big in these new technology.  People have realized the potential of AI and now there is so many tools available. Now it's easier to get people on board with AI project and you can see the impact more now with many technologies with computer vision, etc. There will be more research and breakthroughs in the future.
Now there is more available mentors and resources that will help you learn, mentorship is important for you and how you want to grow(mentor will give you more input and criticism that is very beneficial).

Mentor is very beneficial and you need to reach out to different people in different field. Mentor will be able to push you and show you the path to have a growth mindset.

Why they expertise in this field:
- Computer vision - Laura
  Started when she goes to Boston University - Images that are essentially just number in computer, can be intrepreted by the computer, And this was very interesting.
- Autonomous Driving - Laura
  How autonomous driving can save lives
- Industrial Manifacturing AI - Jay Lee
  How with AI can make manifacturing machine more effectively, and at that time people are very invested with physics. Predict and prevent accidents using AI and data, so that industry will be more safer.
- Pharmacy - Chelsea
  It's interesting how you can apply AI to many things that we cannot predict, like how certain medicine works to certain person, etc. Chelsea thinks it's important to educate other about how important AI can be for healthcare world and being the bridge to help people understand.

What is valuable in this field:
Passion and purpose. You need to engage directly with the end user to found your purpose. To make the world a better and safer place.
Being agile and collaborative, because in this field there is a place for everyone. Don't discount yourself and try starting.

How university play a field in forming one's mission:
Data Quality
How you can make algorithms to solve problem
How you can make AI more understandable to user

University will help you to understand those 3 problem by making you fail more faster, and make you learn from those so you can make breakthroughs. 


What specifics in Python should i get to know to get deeper into AI:
Some core Python specifics would be the data pipeline feeding into AI. Things like numpy, pandas, or NVIDIA's RAPIDS platform.
# How to be a Deep Learning Engineer
Speaker:
- Maying Shen, Senior Deep Learning Research Engineer , NVIDIA
- Louis Stewart, Head of Strategic Initiatives, Developer Ecosystem, NVIDIA
- Jose Alvarez, Senior Research Manager / Principal Scientist, NVIDIA
- Ke Chen, Senior Deep Learning Scientist - Autonomous Vehicles, NVIDIA
- Andrew Russell, Principal Software Engineer, NVIDIA

What is Deep Learning?
Jose: Type of Machine Learning where focuses on data and how to process it to be multiple layer. 
Andrew: Everything, machine that can do everything.

What does Deep Learning Engineer
Ke: DEEP LEARNING PROJECTS! including data accuration, model architecture, analysis, model analysis, deployment, etc. Execution can be literature like understanding the problem, or code, or make models for the project, etc.
Maying: Try to find out a solution, Engineer is the one who try to techincal stuff. Trying models, finding the solution, train models everyday, learn new techniques, and make a better models.

What is DL Engineer Responsibility:
1. Training model
   A lot of waiting and process. There is a lot of time to train models, and see what the result and make changes to perfect it
2. Understanding the problem at hand

What makes a good learning engineer:
Maying: INVESTIGATION SKILLS! As a DL Engineer, you need to investigate what happens in the solution and how you can fix it if the result is not what you expect. Instead of just trying random number, analyze what's the problem and correct your mistake.
Jose: HAVE CRITICAL THINKING! Be able to understand problem and be critical with the result that you get and try to solve that problem.
Ke: BE ADVENTUROUS and dont afraid to try new ways. Be critical with result. IF it's bad, why? If it's good, why?
Andrew: Do not give up


Choose what you passionate -> contribute to that like on an open source, etc -> Apply deep learning to that!
On university, be active to involve in a project in deep learning. 

What Internship do?
To know the diff between academia and industry. Improve coding style and realize what kind of knowledge and skills that you need to improve. Try experience deep learning as a potential future job.

A good mentor will help you on improving:
- [x]  Learn new things
- [x]  Problem Solving
- [x]  Critical Thinking
- [x]  Focus and stay on track

What do you need:
- Math (College math) - to investigate and analyze result, know why something works or why they don't
- Nothing really, try to catch up in a specific field!

just try and come and play :)
deep learning is fun and it's never too late to join to the party
