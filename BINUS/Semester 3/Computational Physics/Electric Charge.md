Structure within the Atom
- Electron
- Neutron and Proton
- Atom
- Nucleus
- Quark

Charge is not created or destroyed, only transferred.
The net amount of electric charge produced in any process is zero.

Electric charge is produced by movement on electron


### Conductor and Insulator
---
**Conductor:** Materials which charge (electron) can move freely; 
example: metals, water, etc.

**Nonconductor**: Materials which charge (electron) cannot move freely
example: rubber, plastic, glass, etc.

**Semiconductor**: Materials in between conductor and nonconductor
example: silicon, germanium

**Superconductor**: Materials that are perfect for conductors, allowing charge to move freely without any hindrance. Normal conductors will convert some of the energy into heat, which is unideal.

Properties of conductors and insulators are due to the structure and electrical nature of atoms.


### Electric Charge and Induced Charge
---
There is (+) and (-) induced charge
(+) means the object charge is losing electron
(-) means the object charge is gaining electron
