Solving a problem can be simplified if the agent can adopt a goal and aim satisfying it.

# Problems Formulation
---
1. The initial State - State where the agent starts
2. Actions - Possible actions available to the agents
3. Transition model - A description what an action does
4. Goal test - Check if given state is a goal state
5. Path cost - Measure the cost to achieve the goal 


h = Performance measurement
Example problems: Path finding using Dijkstra
