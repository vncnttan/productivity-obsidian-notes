An agent is anything with a 
- **sensor** that **perceive its environment** 
- **actuators** that **acts upon the environment**

Simple example:
Percept: Location and contents
Action: Move left/right/forward, clean, stop

[[Performance Measure - AI]]

**PEAS**
Performance: What measure can be used to test the performance 
Environment: What is the environment that the agents will be used for the agents to consider
Actuators: What can be used as an action for the agents
Sensors: What can be used by the agents to percepts environment around them

example for Autonomous Driving
Performance: Safety, Destination, Comfort
Environment: Streets, Highway, etc.
Actuators: Steering, Accelerator
Sensors: video, GPS, keyboard, etc.

Agent-Types
---
Simple Reflex Agents: Action is done based on the current state only, ignore the sensors history
Modal Based Reflex Agents: Sensors and action history is used
Goals Based Agents: Consider also other probabilities to achieve a goal
Utility Based Agents: Based on the utility of the agents also
