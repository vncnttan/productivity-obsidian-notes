## Coulomb's Law
---
The force of repulsion or attraction due to charge properties of objects is called an **electrostatic force**.

(jangan salah, r hat ga di hitung)

*r* = distance between two particle
k = constants

**If the object is not in a vacuum, multiply E0 with Er** 
*Er* (relative permittivity constant)

Notes: Don't forget this is a vector equation, so if the particles are not in a straight line we need to composite the vector
