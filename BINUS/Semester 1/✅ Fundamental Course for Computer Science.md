## Information Technology Devices
---
Information and Technology using computer is applied everyday on our lives, and now it becomes more advanced with *supercomputer (mainframe)* to maintain servers, etc.
Forms of information technology
1. Desktop
2. Mobiles
3. Embedded system (smartwatch etc.)


- Programs - Consists of series of related instruction, tell the computer what task to perform and how to perform them. e.g - simple program (code) printf, adding, etc
- Application / apps - Consists of multiple programs that can be executed in one of the apps platformm (Web app, mobile app, Wearables apps, Web apps)

## Internet and Digital Security
---
Internet consists of millions of computer interconnected with each other, and in the future there will be many more devices connected to the internet
### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing enables us to upload files to the cloud(internet) for us and other with our permission, to access it. Examples are *GDrive, Gclass, etc*. It's basically a storage in other place (not locally) that we can access with internet.

### IoT
Everyday items that will be smater and can be accessed by connect it to the internet, From refrigerators, smartwatch, cctv, smartlight, etc, technologies will become more advanced and we will invent and develop more new things.

### More things to be considered:
1. Internet Ettiquette
2. Health Issues
3. Malware and Viruses
4. Cyber crimes
   Hacking - Breaching into a network or a computer illegally. Accesing into something that we should not have seen
   ID Fraud - Stealing and using someone's ID (Credit Card, NIK, etc)
   DoS attack - Denial of Service, shuts down a server by flooding it with massive data (basically raiding discord server).

Types of Hackers:
1. White hat hackers - The good guys, finding holes and informing it to the devs
2. Black hat hackers - Bad guys, hacking for personal gains, selling data, etc.
3. Grey hat hackers - Combination of the two

## Inside of Computers
---
### Input
`mouse, keyboard, webcam, mic, joystick, touchpad, etc.`
To receive information from the user to the computer.

### Output
`monitors, speaker, etc`
To send information from computer to user

## Components
1. Motherboard
2. Graphics card
3. Sound Adapter
4. Network Adapter
5. Ports
6. PSU
7. Processor - Assign every component with tasks
8. Memory
   RAM - Low Latency (Fast), but expensive and small 
   SDD - RAM but high massive storage capacity, enable computers to boot up under 2S
   HDD - High Latency (Fast), but cheap and big
9. Casing and coolin system

### Parallel & Quantum computing 
The ability to do multiple processing at one time = Parallel Computing
Quantum = Parallel but more advanced

### Operating System (OS)
Bridging between hardware and software
e.g Windows MacOS Linux
## ICT System
---
Group of computers that are working together to make a system, e.g ships system, city, airplane, etc.
5 keys topic:
- Hardware
- Software
- Operating System
- Types of Computer
- Emerging systems (something that is growing now, AI, robotics, encryption, etc.)
- 
## IOT System
---
Internet of Things is a giant network that connect with devices, electrical appliance and other using sensors for you to control them from everywhere. For automation and improving efficiency. e.g machine that sends data about products package code, how machine is running, etc.

Overview
How to make products designed to provide a good user experience?
- Reduce the negative aspects (frustation)
- Enhance the positive aspects (enjoyment)

## Good and Poor Design
---
Product design needs to be interactive and easy to understand.

Some example:
![[Pasted image 20220926120014.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220926120029.png]]

Some Issues
1. Information Overload
   - Understand what the user need
   - Have loads of information conveyed by visuals instead of text.
2. Mystery Meat Navigation
   - Label links
3. Adding Friction to User Actions
   - Avoid adding any kind of friction to user actions as far as you can‚Äîand carefully implement it when you have no alternative.
4. Clever design that ignores usability
   - Clever design should be made foolproof and tested to actual user because clever design can hurt usability
5. Superfluous Animation
   Always make your animation purposeful: too much can kill the UX of a product. Beauty has to pull its weight and be functional.

[[Interaction Design (UX)]]
## Interaction Design
---
Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives.

Who is involved in interactive design?
- Designer
  Need to know many different thing about the user and how they interact with events and technology to create a better user experience.
- Developers
  Need to understand the business, technical, marketing and manufacturing side.
- Multidiciplinary teams
  Teams from many backgrounds with different skill sets
- Other people
  Depends on the compant size, purpose, etc.
