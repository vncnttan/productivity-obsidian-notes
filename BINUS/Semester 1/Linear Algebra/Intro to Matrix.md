Matrix is a rectangular array of number

Matrix size(ordo) is n x m
	contoh matriks (2x2) (3x5) etc.
where n is a row and m is the collumn

if m = n:
the matrix will be square = `square matrix` dengan ordo n.

If matrix is only consists of 1 collumn, it's called `matrix collumn`
If matrix is only consists of 1 row, it's called `matrix row`

Vector only 1 Dimension, so vector matrix usually is either a matrix collumn or a matrix row
	contoh: titik `x = (2,3)`

To select specific element for matrix
A<sub>ij</sub> = elemen baris ke i, kolom ke j.
