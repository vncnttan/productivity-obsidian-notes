Gauss Jordan Using Approximate Method
---
Steo

### Pitfall
---
Pitfall 1: Division by 0 error
Pitfall 2: Large Round off Error

### Avoiding Pitfalls
---
1. Increase the number of significant digit
   Decreases round-off error
   Doesn't solve pitfall 1
2. [[Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting]]
3. UL Decomposition - mingdep
4. Metode Saddle - mingdep

Trivial = The answer is 0
Non-Trivial = The answer is infinite (the solution is an equation with other variable)
