***The result of doc product is a scalar number***

**u . v** = ||u|| * ||v|| cos θ
**u . v** = `(u1*v1 + u2*v2 + ... + un*vn)`


||u|| and ||v|| is found in [[Norm of a Vector]]

With this, you can find, the θ(angle between two vectors) if you are given the two vector

if θ acute: **u . v** > 0
if θ obtuse: **u . v** < 0
if θ orthogonal: **u . v** = 0

orthogonal -> θ = 90<sup>o</sup> = π/2

### Properties
✅ Commutative
✅ Associative
✅ Distributive
✅**v . v >= 0 and v . v = 0** if and only if **v = 0**

✅ Commutative with scalar
✅ Associative with scalar
✅ Distributive with scalar
✅ Multiply by scalar zero will result in [[Zero Vector]]
