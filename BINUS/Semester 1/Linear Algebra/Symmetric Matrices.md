`A square matrix is a symmetric matrix with mirror images, through the main diagonal.`

### Properties of Symmetric Matrices
1. The main property is their transpose is itself. A = A<sup>T</sup>
If A is a symmetric matrix and B is another symmetric matrix
2. A + B = C where C is a symmetric matrix
3. A - B = C where C is a symmetric matrix
4. A.B `can` be equal to B.A
   A.B = B.A â†” A.B = C `(where C is a symmetric matrix)`
   (the multiplication can commute if and only if the result is a symmetric matrix)
   Kalau hasil perkaliannya tidak simetris, maka perkaliannya tidak bisa komutatif
5. k.A = C where C is a symmetric matrix (scalar multiplication)
