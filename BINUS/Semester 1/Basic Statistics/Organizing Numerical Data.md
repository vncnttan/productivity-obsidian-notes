### Preparing before making a Frequency Table
What needed to be decided first? 
- Maximum data (highest value)
- Minimum data (lowest value)
- Number of class
  Jika data banyak ditentukan dengan [Sturges' Rule - statology.org](https://www.statology.org/sturges-rule/#:~:text=Sturges%E2%80%99%20Rule%20uses%20the%20following%20formula%20to%20determine,round%20the%20answer%20up%20to%20the%20nearest%20integer.)
  Jika data sedikit, di kira-kira saja.
- Interval Kelas

### Making a Frequency Table
1. Search maximum and minimum data by using the sort function in excel
2. Find the class interval using the decided number of class, highest value and lowest value.
3. Make the range of classes one by one from the minimum + interval, etc.
4. Search the *frequency* for each class and the total frequency. (by the tally)
5. Search the percentage, by *frequency/total*. The total should be 100
6. Search the *relative frequency* and *relative percentage*, by *frequency/total*
8. Search the *frequency cummulative* and *percentage cummulative*
