What is the difference of Mean and Proportion? #flashcard 
Mean is used to search for average in numerical data, so the answer would be roughly the middle of the numerical data, it's probably more than 1, depending on what's tracked.
Proportion is used to search for the amount of successes in binomial data, it always is between 0 and 1. Proportion is like the probability of sucess.
Mean = sum/N
Proportion = successes/N
