- Pie Chart
  Excels in percentage data visualization
  Easy to understand for more general people
  If there is too many category, or too many little percentages, it might not translate well because it become indistinguishable and unlegible (the category and percentage becomes too small).

- Doughnut Chart
  Pie chart with hole in the middle
  Arguably harder to read

- Pareto Chart
  Harder to understand for general people because it introduce new variable graph (the cummulative line) into the mix. Also maybe hard to send your messages across.
  Very complete because you can also the data relative to other category using the cummulative line.
  `in Ms. Excel use combo icon in the insert tab`
