At first interfaces is using command line interface but now, you can design Graphical User Interface for your application, so now to access or use your program, user don't have to use the application **text-based** interface, but instead, graphical. (Use button, slider, input field, etc. for command, not with command line interface)

[[Event Handlers]] means when you click something, what event should happen.
