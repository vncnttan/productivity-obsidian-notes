Input validation is the process of checking the data entered by the user _before_ that data is saved to the database.

Validating user input before it is written to the database can improve the quality of data stored in your tables. Good validation can also make programs be user-friendly and increase the speed.

Input validation can automatically edit data as the user enters it, instead of telling the user to fix invalid entries. For example, if the data entry for a field must be all in capital letters, the program should automatically convert lowercase characters to upper case instead of waiting until the user enters mixed case, then reporting an error and forcing the user to reenter the data.

### Some Question
1. Is this required field?
2. What characters are valid/invalid
3. For numeric field, is there high/low range
4. Is there a list of valid values for this field?
5. Is this a conditional field?
