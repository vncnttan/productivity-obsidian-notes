A ⊂ B means A is a part of B.
But for A ⊂ B to be true there has to be an element inside of B, but not a part of A. If all element B is an element of A that means two of this set is equal. ^c72a7e

if A is a subset of B. Than that means B is a superset of A.

The subset(*small circle*) is inside of a superset(*big circle*).

### Example
A = {∅, {a}, {b}, {a, b}}
B = {x | x is a subset of the set {a, b}}

element B (x) is the subset of {a, b}. (B is a [[Power sets]] of {a, b}) That means we're gonna try to search every possible combination that can be a subset of {a, b}

P {a, b}
- inside the subset ∅. Outside the subset {a, b}
- inside the subset {a}. Outside the subset {b}
- inside the subset {b}. Outside the subset {a}
- inside the subset {a, b}. Outside the subset ∅

so what's inside the subset
P(a, b) = {∅, {a}, {b}, {a, b}}

so, A = B.
