A pair of isomorphic graph is two graphs that is exactly the same, even though the ordering/position of the vertix can be different that make it confusing!

Example:

How to identify? You can choose one of these method
- Represent them in adjacency/incidence matrix and the result should be exactly the same
- Properties of isomorphic graph:
  1. Have the same edge count
  2. Have the same vertex count
  3. Each vertex have the same degree
  4. Each edge have the same initial & terminal vertex / each vertex have the same neighboring vertex
