Try to find flaw in that equation by searching a contradiction. the explanation circles onto itself because I honestly don't understand it that deep.

```contradiction_rule_of_interference
If p then q

Suppose p

therefore ~q should be false!

if you found a condition where p and therefore ~q is true.. you found a contradiction in that statement
