### Euler circuit
A possible circuit containing every edge in the graph, but not twice

Circuit! the starting point is the end point.

### Euler path
A possible path containing every edge in the graph, but not twice

If not an Euler circuit, a graph may conrtain an euler path, it's okay if the start and end vertex is different
