2. Adjacency matrix
   If symmetrical, must be undirected (two way)
   Diagonal line is the self loop edge

3. Incidence matrix
   Every collumn represent an edge and there will be a pair of vertix that ticks by one, connected to that edge. 
   For every row, you can see how many degree a vertix is connected by counting how many 1s are there
