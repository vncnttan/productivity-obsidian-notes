Linear congruence : a congruence of the form ax â‰¡ b (mod m)

<font color = "red">Remember: You cannot divide both side of congruence using a divisor like you can with equal sign</font>

Fermat Little Theorem
`a^(p-1) = 1 (mod p)` where p is a prime number

Pseudoprimes = composite number that's also can be worked through Fermat Little Theorem (Carmichael): 561, 1279
