> Socrates is a man. All men are mortal. So Socrates is mortal


## Atomic Prepositions is a declarative sentence
that is either true or false, but not both.

*e.g VT is a student.* 
That entire sentence can be symbolized by p or q (`propositional variables`). And each of those variables is either true or false. 

T/B/1 is symbol for true, F/S/0 is symbol for false.

More than one Atomic Preposition that is related, can be combined to make a compound propositions, symbolized by P or Q
*`e.g VT is a student, so he must go to school everyday.`*

P (True or False) possibility can be calculated by their compound propositions
The number of possibility is 2<sup>n</sup> where n is the number of atomic proposition inside of the compound proposition.
