Two sets are deemed equal if and only if they have the same elements. It doesn't matter even though:
- The elements is not ordered the exact same way in both of the function
- There are more than one identical elements inside of a set

The sets { 1, 3, 5 } = { 3, 5,1 } = { 1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 5, 5 , 3, 3}
