1. **Reflexive**
   100% of the origin element have to get a self-loop
   
   Loop is when there is a relation that have the same element (a, a)
   R = {1, 2, 3}
   
   {**(1, 1)**, (1, 2), **(2, 2)**, **(3, 3)**} is reflective
   while {(**1, 1),** (2, 3), **(3, 3)**} is not.
   
   **Irreflexive**
   100%  of the origin element doesn't have a self-loop

2. Symmetric / Anti-symmetric
   At least one pair of relation is symmetric with each other
   
   Symmetric is when the element mirror each other (a, b) and (b, a). This not a reflective element
   
   {(1, 1), **(1, 2), (2, 1),** (2, 3), (3, 3)} is symmetric
   while {(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 3)} is anti-symmetric
   
   **Anti-symmetric**
   100% of the relation doesn't have a symmetric
   
3. Transitive / Anti-Transitive
   100% For every element in a set, there should be an alternative
   
   Transitive is when there is a relation (a, b) and (b, c), there should be a relation of (a, c)
   
   {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)} is transitive
   {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)} is transitive
   {(1,1), (1,2),(1,3),(3,3)} is transitive
   while {(1, 1), **(1, 2), (2, 3)**, (3, 3)}  is anti-transitive because there should be (1, 3)
