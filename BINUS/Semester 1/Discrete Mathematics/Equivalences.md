## Logical Equivalences

Logical Equivalences is a compound proposition that have the same True/False Value with another compound proposition. If the atomic result the same T/F the two compound proposition will evaluate it and produce the same result.

`~(p v q) `and `~p ^ ~q` are logically equivalent


## Identity Equivalence

Identity equivalence are compound proposition that is (logical) equivalence to one identity (not with another compound proposition). The identity can be one of the proposition, or T/F.

So, P ^ T, means P and all True. It's equivalence of just P alone.
