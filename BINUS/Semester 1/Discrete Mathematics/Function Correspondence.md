A function requires the first set to be all have a connection and doesn't have a branch, but it doesn't required for set B to have it all connected

Type of correspondence:
1. One to one functions
   There is no branch in B, but, there can be an element without connection
   Contoh F(x) = x + 1
2. Onto functions
   All B connect with something, but there can be an element that branches.
   Contoh F(x) =  x mod 2 (B = {0, 1})
