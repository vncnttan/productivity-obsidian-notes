Predicates are statements that is neither true nor false w/ variables that are not specified inside of it. The truth value is dependent on the value inside of those variables.
	example:
	`x > 3`
	`Computer x is functioning y.`


Predicates can be symbolized by P(x), and becomes a *propositional function* P at x. Once a value has been assigned to the variable x, the statement become a *proposition* and has a truth value.

Truth Value:
Does that statement T/F?

Another way to assign a truth value to a predicate is by [[Quantifiers]].

Instantiated = Once the variable is assigned with a value
