   0 < 1 < 1.1 < 1.2 dst.
2. Traversal Algorithms

   Like using reccursive
   - Preorder traversal : a, b, e, j, k, n, o, p, f, c, d, g, l, m, h, i
     From the root go to the most left first
   - Inorder traversal: j, e, n, k, o, p, b, f, a, c, l, g, m, d, h, i
     From the most left, go up one and explore all the subtree beside it, from the most deep level going up.
   - Postorder traversal: j, n, o, p, k ,e, f, b, c, l, m, g, h, i, d, a
     From the most left, explore the siblings first. After all siblings traversed, then go up to one parent. Parent is explored after all their child traversed.
