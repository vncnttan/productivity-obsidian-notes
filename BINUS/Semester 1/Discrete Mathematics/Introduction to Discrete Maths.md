Discrete Mathematics

What is Discrete?
individually separate and distinct:
Salah satu pengertiannya adalah bilangan bulat. This means they are all separate. There is no 2.5 etc.

In the past, we used continuous model (continuous maths physics, etc. to make bridges, etc.). for correctness reasoning..
But Computer System are large, complex and **discrete**.

So we need applied discrete maths
- Logic
- Set Theory
- Graph Theory
- Combinatorics
- etc.
