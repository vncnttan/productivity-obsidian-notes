1. Path
   Is the path possible looking through the graph
   Simple path means, there is not an edge that is used twice
2. Circuit
   If the path is possible and the starting vertex is the same as the end vertex.
3. Connected - (for undirected graph)
   If there is a path for every distinct vertices, it is connected

4. Strongly connected 
   There is a path for every two distinct vertices in the graph (two-way), often a circuit.
5. Weakly connected
   ppt dn gugel - if you look at it through the framework and undirected graph, is it connected?
   mr.dave - if it's not strongly connected, it's weakly connected
