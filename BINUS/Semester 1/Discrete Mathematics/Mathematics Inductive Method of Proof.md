Using specific observations to form a general conclusion to identify the truth value of a mathematical formula

Step to prove mathematic equation P(x) is true:
1. Basis Step
   Verify that P(1) is true
2. Induction Step
   Verify that P(k) is true by
	- 2a - Change the x to a k equation
	- 2b - Change the x to a k+1 equation
	  
	  Then finish the left side of the operation by 2a, meanwhile the right side operation by manual.. If the results holds, that means the equation is proven.
