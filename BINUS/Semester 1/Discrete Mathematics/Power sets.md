Power set is the set of all subset from a set.

Example:
- Power set of {0, 1, 2} is {∅, {0}, {1}, {2}, {0, 1}, {1, 2}, {0, 2}, {0, 1, 2}}, size = 8
- Power set of ∅ is {∅}, size = 1
- Power set of {∅} is  {∅, {∅}}, size = 2

The size of a power set is 2<sup>n</sup> where n is the size of the original set
