### Karnaugh Map
The simplification about all of those to be represented visually and easy to understand

K map key functions to simplify the equation. Otherwise it is a very confusing and long expression.
(a) means it's the identity of y
(b) means it can't be simplified anymore
(c) means it can be simplified to be the negate of x plus the negate of y

something + negate something = 1 (gone from mattering in the equation)
(a) x(~y)(~z) + (~x)(~y)(~z) = (~y)(~z)(x + ~x)
=(~y)(~z)

etc etc

> Notes: For every two power collumn coloured connected, one symbol gone from the equation
> ![[Pasted image 20220927172119.png]]the (c) 4 = 2<sup>2</sup> means 2 symbol gone, and the (d) 8 = 2<sup>3</sup> means 3 symbol gone
