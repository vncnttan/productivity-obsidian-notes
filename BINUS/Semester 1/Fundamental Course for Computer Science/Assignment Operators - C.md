  Assignment operators (`=`)
  
  `left-hand-operand = right-hand-operand;`
  Assign data on the *right-hand operand* to the variable in the *left hand operand*.
  
  - [x] Can combined with arithmetic operator to simuntaneously count and assign (`+= -= *= /= %=`). 
	     `x = x + y` is equivalent to  `x += y`.  
  - [x] For arithmetics, you can get the negations of numeric numbers by putting the minus operator right before the number.
        For example, given x = 1.234, -x equals -1.234. Or, given x = -1.234, -x equals 1.234.
