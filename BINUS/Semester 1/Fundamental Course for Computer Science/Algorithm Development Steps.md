## Algorithm Development Steps:
---
1. Problem Definition
   Find the:
   - Problem
   - Data needed
2. Model Development
   Find the general formula to solve that problem using the data needed
3. Algorithm Design
   Make the *pseudocode*: using our model development, you can try to use 'flowchart' to try develop a pseudocode and solve a problem.
4. Start writing code
   Write code, incorporate input for the data needed to be processed. Convert our flowchart or pseudocode into a code.
5. Compile Code and Run
   A process to convert our file to a binary file (translate using compiler, transforming from our language to computer language).
6. Syntax Err 
   Stumbling onto syntax error: Syntax error, grammar, etc
7. Output Error 
   Our program spelt out an unexpected output, something is wrong with our program, so now when executed it doesn't a supposed output.
8. Documentation
   After all is well and run, document it. For other to use and reference ![[Pasted image 20220914095045.png]]
