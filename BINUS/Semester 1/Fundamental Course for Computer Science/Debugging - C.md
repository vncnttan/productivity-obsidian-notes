### Debugging your program

> In the computer world, program errors are also called bugs. In many cases, your C compiler and linker do not find any errors in your program, but the result generated by running the executable file of the program is not what you expect. In order to find those "hidden" errors in your program, you may need to use a debugger.>

You can use the cs50 duck method, print method, or use your IDE debugger! :)
