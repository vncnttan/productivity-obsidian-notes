### Compiling and linking
1. A program written in C (human language) / *source code*. 
2. Compiled by a C compiler (GCC, clang, etc.) -> Make a new file with extension `.o or .obj` (*object file*)
3. Linking (usually handled by compiler too) -> Link the object file with standard C library and other libraries to produce an executable file. The new file is an *executable file* with the extension `.exe or .com`
