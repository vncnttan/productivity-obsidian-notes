Object file and executable file are both machine-dependent, so if you move an executable file, you need to recompile the source code. So every machine has its type of system. BUT ***C IS MACHINE INDEPENDENT***, so in order to move a program to another machine, c is moved, then the new machine will recompile those code. 

meaning: C is portable.
