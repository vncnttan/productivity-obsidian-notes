### Pseudo-code
An artificial and informal language that helps you develop algorithms, similar to everyday English, convenient, and user-friendly.

Pseudocode needs to be detailed, specific, and correct. To execute pseudocode, to produce a correct result, you need to follow the procedure thoroughly and correctly.

Pseudocode uses **KEYWORDS**:
- Input: Read/Get/Input
   [[Input (General)]]
- Output: Print/Write/Put/Output/Display
  To display value inside of a variable, use comma. To display string, use double quotes.
  [[Output (General)]]
- Compute: Compute/Calculate/Add (To do Arithmetic Equation)
  To compute something, the variable should have value first (from input or set).
  [[Arithmetic Operators - C]]
- Store: Set/Value
  [[Assignment Operators - C]]
- Compare: If, then, else : [[Decision Structure]]
  [[Conditional Branching (Selection) - C]]
- Repetition(Looping): DOWHILE, ENDDO
  [[Loop - C]]
- Functions: call
  [[Module]]
  

Pseudocode variables also have [[Identifier - C]] rules.

Example for making a pseudocode: Looping thru all students, counting how many student is Male or Female.

Good pseudocode will produce the:
- Correct result
- Consistent (different people will produce similar result following those pseudocode)

Programming designer will make a peudocode to be passed then to a programmer. Good pseudocode will make the programmer job more clear and will produce the expected code.
