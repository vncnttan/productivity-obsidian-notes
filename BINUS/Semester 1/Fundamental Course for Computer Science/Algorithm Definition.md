Algorithm is sequential of instruction/actions to be executed ***in order*** from start to goal AND the order in which these actions are to be executed.

As a programmer, we need to find a bridge between the starting point and the end goal.
[[Algorithm Development Steps]]

To represent algorithm and explain your algo to other, you can use [[Pseudocode]] or [[Flowchart]]

## Structure Theorem
1. Sequence
2. Selection - [[Conditional Branching (Selection) - C]]
3. Repetition - [[Loop - C]]

## Algorithm Basic
---
Algorithm is an instruction/procedure step by step to process an input to a preffered output. Algorithm needs to be clear, but effective to then we translate to a programming language by coding.

- Having the right logical flow
- Produce the correct output, in the most efficient way.
- Unambigious
- Easy to implement in code
- Clearly defined, started, and ended.


### Another Algorithm Definition 
Step by step of instructions called algorithm!
Computer can do this more efficiently and with accurate precision!

Binary search, search about something by divide the problem in half depending on whether the item that we're going to find is whether it's earlier or later in the book.

Algorithm can also do more complicated things. e.g page rank, how web page is ranked about how many times it referenced by a higher page rank, etc.
