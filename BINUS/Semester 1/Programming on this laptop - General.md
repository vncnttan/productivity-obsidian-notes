Why am I fiddling with JDK, etc?
1. vscode is a text-editor that CAN run debug and compile program IF you download other sources like their extensions, compiler, etc.
2. VS and Eclipse is an IDE that will do all of the setup for you!
`VSCODE requires you to do a TON of set up everytime you want to go to a new language, also with limited capabilities`

What I downloaded for VSCode
1. GNU - C/C++ compiler (already installed when I bought the laptop)
2. Ubuntu WSL - For command line (defaultly powershell but it's hard to use)
3. Bunch of C extensions!

so now:
1. VSCode WSL
   File code Location: Linux/home/Codes

2. Eclipse (IDE) Windows
   Oracle Java SE 17
   File workspace Location: C:/Users/vince/Document/Codes/eclipse-workspace

Also: Eclipse have some limitations when using WSLg, so we save the file on C://
