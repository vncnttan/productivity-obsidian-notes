Finite vs. Non-Finite Automata
- Finite
  Memory limited
	  `in lift analogy: Regular Lift -> No looping`
- Non Finite
  Can theorically remember and unbounded amount of informations
	  `in lift analogy: Dead man lift -> Looping circular`

#### Finite Automata
Mathematical models of computation that consists of a finite number of states and transitions between these states.

Used to recognize patterns and to verify whether a sequence of inputs adheres to a specified protocols
[[Finite State Automata]]

#### The Central Concept of Automata Theory
Revolves around the idea of state transitions based on the input symbols, leading to the acceptance or rejection of sequence. 

Useful for process that require inmput sequences according to specific rules, such as network protocols.
