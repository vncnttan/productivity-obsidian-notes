Phase Analysis:
- Lexical Analyzer
  Breaks the source code into a sequence of tokens
- Syntax Analyzer
  Syntax, Code structure, etc. *(red squiggly lines)* 
  `Checks if the token stream adheres to the grammatical rules of the programming language.`
- Semantic Analyzer
  Spelling, Grammar, Autocorrect, etc. (*yellow squiggly lines*)
  `Checks the meaning and consistency of the code within the context of the language's semantics.`
