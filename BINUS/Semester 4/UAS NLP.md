### Dependency Parsing (Case)
Nonton, jangan males!

### Chatbot (pengertian, kasih contoh, kan ada 2)
Chatbot: Simplest kind of dialogue system

- Carry extended conversation with the goal of **mimicking chats characteristics** of **informal human-human conversation**

Examples:
- Eliza
- ChatGPT
- SIRI
- Alexa

###### Property of human conversation
- Turns
  Conversational turns
- Speech Acts
	- Constatives
	- Directives
	- Commisives
	- Acknowledgements
- Grounding
  Confirmation from both speaker for understanding, etc.
- Sub dialogues and Dialogue Structure
  Structure
- Initiative
  Someone who drive the convo, sometimes back and forth
- Inference and Implicature
  
  ###### Dialogue State Architecture
  Task-based dialogue system that has the goal of helping a user solve a specific task.
- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
- Spoken Language Understanding (SLU)
- Dialogue State Tracker (DST)
- Dialogue Policy
- Natural Language Generation (NLG)
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)
###### Chatbots
Program that participates in turn taking conversations with the aim to understand input (text/speech) and give the appropriate output

- Rule Based
  Rely on predefined rules and patterns to understand and generate responses
  `ex. ELIZA & PARRY -> deterministic, simple logic`
- Corpus Based
  Leverage large datasets (corpora) of text to understand and generate responses.
  `ex Information Retrieval Based: Mitsuku, Cleverbot`
  `ex Machine Learned Sequence Transduction: OpenAI's CHATGPT4 -> data driven, flexible`
