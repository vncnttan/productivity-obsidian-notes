Epsilon: Radius
MinPts: Min points

Core Points: Has more than specified number of points (MinPts) in Epsilon (radius), else it is border points or noise points.
- Border Point: If any of the neighboring is a core point
- Noise Point

	Step 1. Search for core points, border points, and noise points.
	Step 2. Remove noise points.
	Step 3. Reachable is if the core point is within the epsilon radius, if connected, then join the reachable core points into one. If not, then create the new cluster for the new core points.
	Step 4. Border Point will search for nearest core point, then join that cluster.
