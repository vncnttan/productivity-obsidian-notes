- Supervised Learning
	The learning process must input the label
	Given the input and the expected output 
	Why use label? Output from the machine will be compared to the expected output. The loss will be calculated and used to improve the machine further.

- Unsupervised Learning
	The learning process doesn't include the label
	Find hidden structure in the data
	
- Reinforcement Learning
	The machine will be penalized and rewarded based on the machine performance
	Why RL? Environment variation and condition for the data is very wide so there is not sufficient input data

Contoh RL:
ChatGPT setelah di training menggunakan Supervised Learning, akan ada RL lagi dari Feedback user apakah user puas dengan output yang dihasilkan oleh Machine Learning

Reinforcement Learning:
- Policy Based 
- Value Based
- Model Based
