1. Batch Learning
   The input is batches of data, system input datanya akan menggunakan semua data every single time, the model get trained with the accumulated data from time to time at periodic intervals:
   - Usually uses offline data
   - All available data every single time
   - Strength: More accurate and reliable
   - Weakness: Huge computational power
     
2. Stochastic/Online Learning
   The input is mini batches of data
   - Usually uses online data
   - Uses mini batches of data
   - Retraining model
   - Strength: Fast and cheap
   - Weakness: Unreliable
