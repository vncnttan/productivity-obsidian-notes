#### Kernel on SVM
Kernel is used due to a set of mathematical functions used in SVM provides window to manipulate the data, it transform the training set of data to that a non-linear decision surface is able to transform to a linear equation in a high number dimension spaces.

**Kernel is used when dealing with non-linear data**, where a clear separation with hyperplane isn't possible. Kernel acts as powerful tools that transform its original feature space into a higher-dimensional space where linear separation becomes feasible.

Functions of Kernel in SVM:
1. Mapping to a higher dimensions
2. Inner product calculation - Avoiding the explicit calculation in the high-dimensional space, which can be computationally expensive
3. Hyperplane construction - Finds the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin in the high-dimensional space


Common Kernel Function:
1. Linear Kernel
2. Polynomial Kernel
3. Radial Basis Functions (RBF Kernel)
4. Sigmoid Kernel
